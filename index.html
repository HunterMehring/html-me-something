                <p>Then taking the Leonardo Express straight into the city. There are other ways to get into Rome, but the other airports are small and crowded, and taking
                    a taxi to get into Rome can get you into some serious traffic during the rush hours. The train is simple enough, just follow the signs for the train 
                    and then use one of the ticket computers and buy as many tickets as you need. Tickets cost around &euro;11, and it departs every 30 minutes from 5:30am 
                    to 11:30pm.</p>
                <p>Once you get into the city you might want to find a place to eat. If you need to drop off your bags there is a place to do so right inside the train station. 
                    For food you have many options near the station.You can find many places to choose from 
                    <a href="https://theculturetrip.com/europe/italy/articles/where-to-eat-near-termini-station-in-rome/" target="new">here</a>. There are an endless amount of 
                    places you can start when looking for something to do. To better organize what you are doing, we recommend planning your days ahead of time to limit on 
                    transportation. One of your days should be spent exploring the Vatican City, where St. Peterâ€™s basilica and the Sistine Chapel are. The museum to get into 
                    the Sistine chapel does take a few hours through, so plan accordingly. 
                </p>
                <p>It would not be difficult to wrap up all the other major destinations in Rome into 2 days. You cannot go to Rome without seeing the Colosseum. Right next to 
                    the Colosseum there is the Roman Forum which is a park filled with hundreds of ancient Roman ruins. There is the famous Pantheon, which was an old roman 
                    temple converted to a church. Those are the main essentials for when in Rome. There are a few other places that if you have time I would not skip. They 
                    are the Trevi Fountain, Castle St. Angelo, Spanish Steps, Altare della Patria, Altare della Patria, and Piazza del Popolo. After you're done in Rome, hop on

                <p>Florence, also known as "the eternal city", is a gorgeous city that has much more of a small city feel than Rome. The streets are much smaller, quieter, and cleaner. But just becasue the city is 
                    smaller does'nt mean that there isn't anything to do there. The city is full of amazing museums, food, and scenic views. For food i recommend the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercato_Centrale_%28Florence%29" target="new">Mercato Centrale Firenze</a>. This san-lorenzo-central-market
                    was an old train station that has been converted into an eatery with gourmet restaurants on top and a market on the ground floor. All of it is very delicious.</p>
                <p>There are a number of <a href="https://www.florence-museum.com/booking-tickets.php?msclkid=8f2a1397f7291c232265480bdc46b2de&utm_source=bing&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=S%20Florence%20museum%20Stati%20Uniti%20EN&utm_term=museums%20in%20florence&utm_content=Florence%20museum" target="new">museums</a> 
                in florence to choose from. By far the most popular are the <a href="http://www.accademia.org/" target="new">Accademia</a> and the <a href="https://www.uffizi.it/en/the-uffizi" target="new">Uffizi galleries</a>
                in the Accademia you will find many breathtaking pieces, but the crown jewel of the museum is the <br> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_%28Michelangelo%29" target="new">Statue of David</a>
                The uffizi is another amazing museum full of historical art. I recommend spending anywhere from half a day to a full day at both of these museums.</p>
                <p>The centerpiece of the entire city is the <a href="https://www.museumflorence.com/" target="new">Duomo</a> which is a cathedral which opened it's doors in 1436. Because of height
                restrictions in the city, the Duomo towers over anything else in the city, and it is a marvel to look at anywhere you are in the city. Because of this, I recommend 
                that you go to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piazzale_Michelangelo" target="new">Piazzale Michelangelo</a> to see the best view in Florence. It is a bit of a walk, 
                but the views are absolutely stunning; especially during sunset. To get to the Piazzale Michelangelo make sure to go across the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponte_Vecchio">old bridge(Ponte Veccio)</a>. The views from outside the bridge
                are much more impressive than once you actually go across. In years past there were markets and goldsmiths, but now there are just a bunch of overpriced jewlery shops.</p>
                <p>There are also many other attractions in Florence which you can find <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Products-g187895-Florence_Tuscany.html" target="new">here</a></p>

                <p>Venice is an amazing city to go around and walk a little bit. It is easy to get lost in the streets, but that is ok, becasue there is always something you'll find. 
                    The cathedral in Venice is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Mark%27s_Basilica" target="new">St Mark's Basilica</a> The basilica is free, so that is always 
                    a great place to start.</p>
                    <p>The most traditional thing to do in Venice is to go on a gondola ride. However, those can cost you almost $100 for only a half hour. If you must go on a gondola ride, then make sure you do your research so you 
                    don't get ripped off.</p>
                    <p>Something that might be a little out of the ordinary is to go to the Dolomite Mountain range. This could easily be a day trip to get away from the city for just
                        a little bit, and it is worth it. The views are truly stunning. There are a number of <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g187870-d11447787-Dolomite_Mountains_and_Cortina_Small_Group_Day_Trip_from_Venice-Venice_Veneto.html"target="new">tours</a>
                        that you could take through the mountains. </p>
                    <p>I always like to get a good skyline view of the city that I'm in. Venice really only has one place where you can do this, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Mark%27s_Campanile" target="new">San Marco Bell Tower</a>. </p>
                    <p>One last thing that I would recommend is to visit Murano, the glass blowing island. Murano is a little bit north of Venie, so you will have to take a short
                        water taxi to get over there. Make sure you get there early becasue a lot of the shops there close early. If you are lucky enough you may see some of the owners working on some of their new art. </p>
